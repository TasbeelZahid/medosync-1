                  I declare that at the time the expenses were incurred I/the
                  patient was entitled to private medical insurance benefits
                  under my/the patient’s chosen laya healthcare scheme. I
                  declare that my/the patient’s doctor recommended the
                  specialist treatment and to the best of my knowledge and
                  belief the information given on this form is true and
                  complete. I authorise and request the hospital/specialist/

                  healthcare or its duly authorised agents acting on its behalf
                  (including, but not limited to, medical professionals whose
                  services are retained by laya healthcare for the purpose of
                  assessing claims) with all necessary information as laya
                  healthcare or its authorised agents may seek in connection
